## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO.
-   **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. No external frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind) were used, ensuring a lightweight footprint.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles DOM manipulation, form logic, and language translation.
-   **Google Fonts**: Uses the **Inter** font family for a modern, clean typography.
